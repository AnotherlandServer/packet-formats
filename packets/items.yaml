      Tells the client to add one item to the item list of 
      the Avatar with Id `avatarId`. 
      The item params need to specify the container (Param `containerID`)
      and inventory slot index (Param `inventorySlotIndex`).
      `containerID` is referencing a well known id for certain containers.
      Possible values are:
        - 0 - CT_INVENTORY
        - 1 - Equipped
        - 2 - CT_STORAGE
        - 3 = unknown
        - 5 = unknown (possibly Bank account)
